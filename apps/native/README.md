# native

This is the react native app for the Ternoa assessment.

## Getting Started

This app is made with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) but if you want to run it independently you can use the following commands:

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AntoineKM/ternoa-assessment
```

2. Go to the app directory

```bash
cd ternoa-assessment/apps/native
```

3. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Now you can use the following commands:

- `yarn dev` - Runs `next dev` to start the native app in development mode

## Choices

- TypeScript - For type safety
- React Native - For building the app
- Styled Components - For styling the web app

## Disclaimer

I only had time to start this assessment, so many features are missing and remain unfinished.
